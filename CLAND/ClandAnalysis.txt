CANDY-LAND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Author: u/zoox101 -- Data By: u/Gandalfrod
For any corrections please PM u/zoox101

Probability of a minion kill spawning a boss:
Mean:      14.53%
95% CI:    11.90% - 17.17%

Probability of getting nothing from a boss: 
Mean:      36.00%
95% CI:    26.59% - 45.41%

Probability of getting a candy ring from killing a boss:
Mean:      7.00%
95% Conf*: P < 12.75%

Probability of getting a peppermint snail from killing a boss:
Mean:      8.00%
95% Conf*: P < 13.98%

Probability of getting a ST or whiteBag from killing a boss: 
Mean:      1.00%
95% Conf*: P <  4.66%

Probability of getting a potion from killing a boss:
Mean:      9.00%
95% Conf*: 5.52% - 15.17%

* Confidence levels are determined by finding the probability for which a binomial gives a less than 5% chance of resulting in the sampled value. See R code for more info.
